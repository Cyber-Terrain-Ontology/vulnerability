# Vulnerability
The concept of a vulnerability is used widely in the cybersecurity communities. We tend to generaly agree upon the definition of a vulnerability, but we need a set of precise definitions in order to form an unabiguous taxonomy.
# An Integration of Concepts
The various concept definitions of what a vulnerability is must be considered in relationship to one another.  
## Multiple Sources
### Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE)
A very common understanding of vulnerability comes from NIST and the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln). The Cyber Terrain Ontology considers the NVD definition of a vulnerability to be a low level definition with very specific datatype and object properties. The nature of the vulnerabilities in the NVD are *defect* vulnerabilities in that they represent a flaw in some software, firmware, or hardware.
### Mid-level Taxonomies
Representations like the [OVAL Representation](https://oval.mitre.org/) expand the definitions of vulnerabilities to include *configuration* vulnerabilities. These are vulnerabilities that may not have defects in the software, but expose a weakness due to improper configuration (e.g. not resetting a default password).
### STIX an Upper-level Specification
Representations such as the [STIX 2.1 Specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html) address the definition of a vulnerability at a high level of abstraction.
